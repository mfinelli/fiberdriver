fiberdriver
===========
Fiberdriver is a way to easily manage your server without changing configuration files.

Goals
-----
- Lightweight
- Secure
- Modular
- Mobile friendly
Fiberdriver will be centered around *tasks* instead of *software*.
Fiberdriver will install a webserver automatically. The default is nginx but it will be possible to choose apache and possibly others during install.
